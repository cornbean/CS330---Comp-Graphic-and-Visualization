1.	How do I approach designing software?
    a.	I approach designing software with a focus on clean and well written code, with plenty of comments so others can easily figure out what is going on. Keeping a clean and focused attitude towards coding will help on future projects as it will help streamline the process and allow easy collaborations with others.
2.	How do I approach developing programs?
    a.	I approach developing programs with the idea of iteration at the very core. I also run the program whenever I change or add something to it to make sure it works like it is supposed to right then and there, instead of adding multiple things at once and then trying to figure out which one is causing the issue. 
3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    a.	Computer science can help me reach my goals in that I want to have a job in this field, namely either Cybersecurity or development. Having a strong foundation will lead to better understanding of future courses and help grasp future concepts with less restriction. Computational graphics and visualizations gave me knowledge by teaching me how to think outside the box with how to solve problems.
